# S_and_P_500_App

## Equity Market Monitoring App


Purpose: “To simulate an equity trend monitoring tool that analysts can use to observe macro market movements and inform operational decisions.”

Use case: “Supports pre-trade and post-trade analytics by giving traders and ops teams insight into volatility, momentum, and macro indicators.”

In this project, I scraped S&P table from Wikipedia, carried out preliminary analysis segmenting the data by Sector in a Jupyter notebook as a proof of concept.
Also, I integrated this data with the Yahoo finance data to obtain stock prices. This can be found in the S&P 500 Analysis file. Then I deployed an app hosted locally using Streamlit.
