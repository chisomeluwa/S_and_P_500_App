# S_and_P_500_App

by Chisom Eluwa

## This is a Data Science/Exploratory Data Analysis Project

In this project, I scraped S&P table from Wikipedia, carried out preliminary analysis segmenting the data by Sector in a Jupyter notebook as a proof of concept.
Also, I integrated this data with the Yahoo finance data to obtain stock prices. This can be found in the S&P 500 Analysis file. Then I deployed an app hosted locally using Streamlit.

This will be deployed live so everyone can interact with the data
